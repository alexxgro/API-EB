This is a very raw program, as explicitly requested.

- cleanup make files, they are not tidy yet.
- configuration file
- unit tests
- declare static value s(return codes, etc) instead of using them hard coded
- split Routes.cpp EventRoute into smaller methods
- ? truncate zeroes from returned values ?
- use a Json Formatter instead of hand formatting the Json
- add defensive coding, a lot of scenarios aren't protected
- create custom namespace around classes
- use c++17 and std::optional for some return values
